This repository is included here as a way to keep all Utopia Scientific code together in one place. See below for description.

"Scripts and publicly available data files used for the statistical analyses for a study on how male African elephants respond to pre-recorded estrous calls in Etosha National Park, Namibia. Due to an ongoing hormone study for this population, raw testosterone data has not yet been made publicly available.

The scripts below can be used to replicate all statistical modeling and conclusions reported in the manuscript of our study, "Male African Elephant (Loxodonta africana) Behavioral Responses to Estrous Call Playbacks May Inform Conservation Management Tools," recently submitted to the MDPI's Animals journal for a special issue on elephant communication.

Authors: Caitlin E. O'Connell-Rodwell, Monica N. Sandri, Jodie L. Berezin, Jaquelyn M. Munevar, Colleen Kinzley, Jason D. Wood, Maggie Wisniewska, and Werner Kilian

Questions regarding the data or scripts can be directed to: ceoconnell@stanford.edu.

Thanks, and enjoy!"
